Dinify Product Analysis and Suggestions

Understanding the Business

Dinify is an instant ordering and order management platform designed to enhance the Speed of Service (SoS) and Operational Efficiency (OE) for restaurants and food trucks in Canada. The platform consists of a client-facing application for customers to place orders and a restaurant dashboard for managing orders, menus, and floor layouts.

Your findings on how we can improve our UI (including minor UI fixes, mainly include about Manage Menu and Orders Page on business-demo.dinify.io)

1⇒When I selected items and adding to cart https://business-demo.dinify.io/app/floorlayout
If i selected Vadapav and added to cart, I searched another items and , if i again added vadapav, it is taking vadapav items 2, it is taking it as new item added to cart.
⇒Onclick Dinify text text in the header is not clickable suggestable to redirect link to home as logo has.
⇒ analytics dashboard should be first page suggestable, Profile page can show with profile at right corner at header 
⇒Profile account page showing in first tab and last tab, 1 is enough.
⇒logout option dont show directly, better put in profile page
⇒On this page https://business-demo.dinify.io/app/dashboard, on hover of Takeout order is curser should change to pointer as it clickable and showing modal ui.
⇒In this page, https://business-demo.dinify.io/app/CRM, Select dates of filtration are no validations, as first from date should be less than to date and both dates should be no future dates.
